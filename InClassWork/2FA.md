# Two-Factor Authorization - In Class Work / CEG 2410

### Name: Cody Southworth 

## 2FA and you:
The main two-factor authenticator I use daily is for signing into Pilot. When signing into Pilot as a student, after we have successfully inputted our email and password it takes us to a second page where it prompts us for a 2FA with an application that has us use what they call a "push" sent to your mobile device where you confirm that push was from you. If you approve of the push then you will be successfully logged into Pilot with your account
