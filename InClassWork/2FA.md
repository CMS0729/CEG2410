# Two-Factor Authorization - In Class Work / CEG 2410

### Name: Cody Southworth 

## 2FA and you:
- The main two-factor authenticator I use daily is for signing into Pilot. When signing into Pilot as a student, after we have successfully inputted our email and password it takes us to a second page where it prompts us for a 2FA with an application that has us use what they call a "push" sent to your mobile device where you confirm that push was from you. If you approve of the push then you will be successfully logged into Pilot with your account
- The second example of a 2FA I use is for my Nord VPN account. When logging in from an unknown device or unknown IP adress, I have it setup where there is a 2FA process that must be completed. Just like I used in the first example, I also use Duo Mobile for this as well. However in this process the steps are a bit different. When I sucessfuly input my login details for my Nord VPN account, this time instead of a push it send a random 5 digit/letter code to duo mobile. I then have to retrieve that code from the application and input it into the login site. If it matches what was sent then I have a sucessfuly login.
