## Your data & backups
- Personal:
  - My current backup strategies for my personal files/data is storing it on external drives. I have personal documents such as medical information, financial information on the external drive. I also even have the data I have on my iPhone backed up on my personal desktop and on the iCloud. 
  - My current backup strategies for work related is pretty much the same as my strategies as my personal. I wholesale contruction materials so I need to have files for tax purposes, any transactions that I make, files for my inventory of what materials I have, and transactions for when I am purchasing my materials. I keep all of this data stored on my personal desktop and a external drive as well. 
  - My current backup strategy for any schoolwork related data is pretty lackluster. This is by far my worst area for backups. The only backup strategy I truly have for schoolwokr related data is classes that require Github. If a class does not utilize Github then I only have my files stored on my personal desktop. 

## Improved Backup Strategy
- An improved backup strategy I could impelement for my schoolwork would be utilizig both Guthub or OneDrive and an external USB flash drive that is portable. I have actaully gave some thought to this strategy last semester. I wanted to setup a private Github repo, that has all of my courses in their own individual files. Every assignments or notes would be uploaded to the repo whenever needed and then I would also have the repo on my personal desktop as well. Then I would also utilize the external USB flash drive by copying over the Github repo on my desktop to the device, that way anytime I cannot acess my Github repo for any reason I can travel with the USB flash drive whenever needed. I could take that another step further by having a backup of all of these files on OneDrive as well to just have a second webserver that keeps files stored.
