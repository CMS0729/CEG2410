# Backups - In Class Work

## Your data & backups
- Personal:
  - My current backup strategies for my personal files/data is storing it on external drives. I have personal documents such as medical information, financial information on the external drive. I also even have the data I have on my iPhone backed up on my personal desktop and on the iCloud. 
  - My current backup strategies for work related is pretty much the same as my strategies as my personal. I wholesale contruction materials so I need to have files for tax purposes, any transactions that I make, files for my inventory of what materials I have, and transactions for when I am purchasing my materials.
